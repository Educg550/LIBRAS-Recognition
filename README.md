# Libras Alphabet Transcriber


## :bulb: Inspiration

LIBRAS stands for "_LÃ­ngua Brasileira de Sinais_", translating to **Brazilian Sign Language** in English. It serves as the primary mode of communication for millions of deaf individuals in Brazil.

The development of a Libras Alphabet Transcriber in real-time using AI and Machine Learning crucial for promoting inclusivity and enhancing accessibility for the deaf community in Brazil. 
While numerous projects have focused on American Sign Language (ASL), there is a noticeable gap in the availability of tools specifically tailored to Libras.

The application provides educational advantages by creating inclusive learning environments for students who are deaf or hard of hearing, as well as for individuals interested in learning Libras.

Leveraging technology to bridge the communication gap is essential for creating a more inclusive society :blush:

## :computer: What it does

![Example](https://gizmodo.uol.com.br/wp-content/blogs.dir/8/files/2021/02/nyan-cat-1.gif)

Libras Alphabet Transcriber is Python program that utilizes Computer Vision and Machine Learning technics to recognize and transcribe Brazilian Sign Language 
(LIBRAS) alphabet gestures using your webcam or video in real-time. The program uses the and Hand Tracking module to detect hand landmarks, and based on its coordinates,
employs a machine learning algorithm to classify and transcribe the corresponding sign language alphabet.
